# Video Game Sales & Market Analysis

This project explores trends in global video game sales, platform performance, and genre popularity using historical data. The goal was to identify which platforms and genres performed best in North America, Europe, and Japan, and to examine how critic scores and user reviews relate to game success.

I used Python to clean, analyze, and visualize the data, and conducted hypothesis testing to compare user ratings across platforms and genres.

## Key Insights

- Action and Shooter games are the top-performing genres in North America and Europe, while RPGs dominate in Japan.  
- Critic scores have a small to moderate positive relationship with sales across most platforms, while user scores show weaker and sometimes negative relationships.  
- **Regional platform leaders**:  
  - North America: PS4 leads in total sales, followed by Xbox One and 3DS.  
  - Europe: PS4 leads, followed by PS3 and 3DS.  
  - Japan: 3DS dominates, followed by PS4 and PS3.  
- ESRB ratings show regional differences in impact, with “M” and “E” leading in NA/EU, and “E” preferred in Japan.
